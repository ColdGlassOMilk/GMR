# Advanced Topics

In-depth guides for advanced GMR usage.

## Topics

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Bytecode Compilation](bytecode.md) | How scripts are compiled and loaded |
| [Project Structure](project-structure.md) | Organizing your game files |
| [IDE Integration](ide-integration.md) | VSCode setup, language metadata |

## When You Need These

Most games work fine with the basics covered in [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) and the [API Reference](../api/README.md). These advanced topics are useful when:

- **Bytecode**: Understanding debug vs release builds, troubleshooting script loading
- **Project Structure**: Organizing larger games with multiple scripts
- **IDE Integration**: Setting up autocompletion and syntax highlighting
